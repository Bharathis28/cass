Unit Tests for JobRunner
=========================
Tests Cloud Function invocation and retry logic.

Test Coverage:
- test_job_runner_retries_then_fails: Verify retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- test_trigger_function_success: Test successful Cloud Function invocation
- test_trigger_function_connection_error: Test connection error handling

    Test that JobRunner attempts exactly 3 retries before failing.

    Simulates a Cloud Function that consistently returns 500 errors.
    Verifies:
    - JobRunner makes exactly 3 retry attempts
    - Each retry waits 2 seconds (retry_delay)
    - Final result is (False, error_data) after all retries exhausted

    Uses time.time() mocking to verify retry delays without actually sleeping.
